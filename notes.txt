where works before group but order by after grouping so you may have to give all parameters of order by in group by as well.
alias can't be used in where & group by.
Aggregates can't be used in where (possible in having), so u must return it from subquery itself or use join. Group by is must to use aggregate with join.
In join give sub query an alias to access it more than once, use with...as to give alias to subquery to use anywhere later.
Even after join a, b u can access a.c, b.d.
In PLSQL, if exists is not allowed, use select...into, exit instead break.
Cursor for loop does only fetch, it can't be used directly for updating row.
use left join instead cartesian, avoid brute force join too amap, be careful of null & use distinct in join,
see ur sql old online solutions. never use between as it can't compare tuples.
